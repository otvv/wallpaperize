`wallpaperize!` is a web app made purely with JS, CSS and HTML. 

This web app is inspired by another app also called [wallpaperize](https://github.com/Philip-Scott/wallpaperize) which was made by [**Philip Scott**](https://github.com/Philip-Scott), unfortunately this app was made exclusively for a Linux distribution called _ElementaryOS_ and the app is not being mantained anymore.
Since this app was something I've used on a regular basis when I was using ElementaryOS, I've decided to make something more widely available for other Linux distros or even other *OS*`es (As long as it supports a modern web-browser).

<summary>todo:</summary>
  
-   maybe bundle malua with webpack or turn malua into a sub-module (I might do one of these after `malua` "first" public release)
-   improve web app design (add a description, logo, mobile friendly design, etc)
-   ~~add an example image in the README.md file~~
