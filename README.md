`wallpaperize!` is a web app made purely with JS, CSS and HTML. 

This web app is inspired by another app also called [wallpaperize](https://github.com/Philip-Scott/wallpaperize) which was made by [**Philip Scott**](https://github.com/Philip-Scott), unfortunately this app was made exclusively for a Linux distribution called _ElementaryOS_ and the app is not being mantained anymore.
Since this app was something I've used on a regular basis when I was using ElementaryOS, I've decided to make something more widely available for other Linux distros or even other *OS*`es (As long as it supports a modern web-browser).
